# Validation

--WIP--

## Find real people from your target market

You identified your target market, now find real people who will be able to give feedback on your idea and maybe become your first customers.

## Create a concept of your product

Use the skills in your team to create this first concept. It could be a clickable powerpoint presentation, an interactive mockup, a bubble website, a thunkable app

## Get feedback

Get feedback from the real people you found, ask them what they do/don't like, if they'd pay for it and if not what would it take for them to pay for it

## Iterate

Improve/change your concept and maybe your target market as many times as needed until you find a product and an approach your target market is ready to pay for

## Tools

* [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com)

## Transition

Once you found your product/market fit, you can proceed to preparing your [business strategy](strategy.md)
