# Idea

Write down everything that comes to mind, if you think of several products, just create separate notes, don't think about the naming for now.

Share your thoughts with your family, friends, don't worry about your idea being stolen, at this stage, it is 99.999999% certain **many** other people had a similar idea.
Their thoughts will help you shape your idea and maybe already change it to something else or maybe abandon it and switch to another idea.

Now, ask yourself the question: **Who is this idea helping?** If you know anyone then discuss your idea with them.
